# easyqueue
A web app for easily setting up a waiting list. Reservation systems are a solved problem for those who care enough about it. People check in, they get a text when their turn is up, and everyone is happier.

The goal of this project is to easily establish a one-off reservation system. People check in, provide an email, and receive a message when they are next up. I want setting up a queue to be frictionless and bound only to an email. "Checking in" would be done on an ipad or with a qr code or a special URL.
